## Quantium-Data-Analytics

# Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. 
# This is to satisfy their customerâ€™s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities.
# The Quantium analytics team are engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful.
